# FoodTek Flutter App

This project is a Flutter-based implementation of the FoodTek mobile application, designed as a frontend prototype based on a given Figma UI design.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to recreate a food delivery application from Figma to Flutter with a high focus on:

- **Pixel-perfect UI matching** of the provided Figma screens.
- **Responsive design**: layouts dynamically adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Custom animations** using Lottie for a smooth, aesthetic experience.
- **Unique visual identity**: careful attention to UI theming, spacing, and color harmony.
- **State management** using `flutter_bloc` for scalable, testable business logic separation.

## Features
- âœ… Modular architecture with proper directory structure (`MVC`-based).
- âœ… Replaced static images with **Lottie animations** for better visual appeal.
- âœ… **Color palette redesigned** for visual distinction and brand uniqueness.
- âœ… Responsive units powered by custom `responsive.dart` utilities (battle-tested).
- âœ… Basic cart and favorites logic implemented using `Cubit`.
- âœ… Dynamic grid/list rendering from local dummy data.
- âœ… Bottom Navigation routing with persistent state.
- âœ… Localization support added (English + RTL-ready).
- ðŸ•“ **Order flow under development** (map tracking / checkout not finalized).

## Roadmap
- [ ] Complete Order Flow (Track Order, Checkout, Live Map Integration).
- [ ] Integrate Backend APIs once delivered.
- [ ] Implement data persistence for cart/favorites.
- [ ] Unit and widget testing.
